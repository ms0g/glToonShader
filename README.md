# glToonShader

## Overview
Toon shading, also known as cel shading, is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to give a 3D scene a stylized, cartoon-like appearance. Unlike traditional shading methods that aim for realistic lighting and shadows, toon shading simplifies the lighting model to create a more flat, graphic look reminiscent of traditional hand-drawn animation.
